Thank you for considering me for this position. I have always been a late bloomer of sorts. I feel that I have truly found my passion in software and web development. It is my passion and mission to help others find their true potential in this discipline if that's where their interests are. I am fond of quoting Michael Hartl, author of the best selling Ruby on Rails Tutorial. He famously said that 'tech is the new literacy." I see web technology as the new frontier in human social evolution. The internet has given voices to individuals that would have never had voices without this advancement. I perceive the potential for good in this technology as a counter balance to the evil that we have inevitably seen arise as well. As educators, we have the power to shape the future with our actions today. I see this as an amazing opportunity to give beyond my existence; to plant a shade tree under which I will never sit as the saying goes. I would be grateful to pursue this endeavor with Coding Dojo and I thank you again, in advance, for considering me for this role. I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm Regards,

Tyler Maxwell


My degree is in philosophy, but I have completed course work in several 'hard science' subjects including inorganic and organic chemistry and advanced mathematics. I also consider myself a life long learner and continuously strive to expand my education in computer science and other subject matter.


I completed the online course in web development with Flatiron. My course of study was web development in Ruby on Rails and React/Redux.
